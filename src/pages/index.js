    <h1>Hi I'm Terence</h1>
    <p>I'm a high school computer science/engineering teacher!</p>
    <p>Just trying to find my first SWE job. 
       Nowadays, when I'm not teaching, I mainly work in React/ES6,
       Node.js, and Python.

       In school, I learned about Java/C/C++, and
       got good in Python. 

       I've been teaching CS fundamentals for
       a really long time and have made tons of short
       workshops.

       Can't wait to attend the JAMstack hackathon!</p>
